# TODO

 * <del>Post creation and editing calls.</del>
 * Asynchronous handling of calls, so that the user doesn't have to wait for the execution to complete before receiving a response. (Requires some sort of persistent data store)
 * Page creation and editing calls?
 * More intricate authentication scheme (or pluggable schemes) for multiple users?
 * Packaging for distributions with wrappers, etc.
 * Go unit tests and benchmarks.
 * Friendly UI for those who aren't strictly talking to the API.
 * <del>Versioned API (/api/VERSION/callgoeshere) for compatibility.</del>
